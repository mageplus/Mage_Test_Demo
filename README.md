# Foo_Bar - the dead simple Mage_Test demo module

This module is as simple as possible, it demonstrates how you can use Mage_Test (https://github.com/mageplus/Mage_Test) for test driven development (TDD) within Magento

At the moment, this module only demonstrates how to use Mage_Test with models

The demo will be expanded upon in the future, to demonstrate how to work with helpers, blocks, controllers and fixtures
